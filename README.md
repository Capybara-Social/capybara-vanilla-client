# Capybara Vanilla Client
The official Capybara client made in vanilla javascript


## Why?
We made this repository and client to prove that frameworks aren't strictly necessary to make a social app.
Since all webpages use a framework like Vue, Angular, Svelte or libraries like React, we decided to make a none-framework client.
We think that all this frameworks may cause different sites to be (sometimes) slower. But do not misunderstand us! We love JS Frameworks! But sometimes is better to program in the old rusty and lovely JS!
